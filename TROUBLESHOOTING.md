# Reusable Fixes

Search this repository's active cases and read only the matching entry.
Check current applicability; historical success is not device readiness.
A recorded fix grants no action or platform authority. Reuse only this
repository's records; never transfer lessons or maintain global memory.
Host-specific facts stay ignored in `TROUBLESHOOTING.local.md`; never store secrets or protected content.

## Compact entries

Use 4–8 nonblank source lines per case, including its stable KI heading:
**Recognize**, **Fix**, **Prevent or limit**. Keep necessary applicability
and authorization limits; dates and diagnostic detail are optional.
Add or update only useful prevention after recovery at the original operation.
Do not log every recurrence or require a detailed report.
Original evidence is preserved in [TROUBLESHOOTING_DETAILS.md](TROUBLESHOOTING_DETAILS.md).
Read only a matching detail section when the compact entry is insufficient;
the preserved historical schema is not the current workflow. Further detail is optional.

## KI-0001: Windows sandbox Git ownership check blocks a repository

- **Recognize:** Windows sandbox Git reports `detected dubious ownership`
  for an authorized repository; filesystem provisioning is a separate issue.
- **Fix:** With explicit persistent Git-trust approval, add only its exact path:
  `git config --global --add safe.directory <absolute-repository>`; verify normal `git status`.
- **Prevent or limit:** No wildcard/system trust or automatic derived-project trust.
  Dependency, engineering, release, access and Git-action authority remain separate.

## KI-0002: Skill validator lacks its YAML dependency

- **Recognize:** Skill validation stops with `No module named 'yaml'`.
- **Fix:** Prefer the project's Python manager and isolated environment; use the pinned
  dependency via `scripts/Test-CodexSkill.ps1 -PythonPath <exact-interpreter>`.
- **Prevent or limit:** Check current interpreter readiness; a new clone has no transferred `.venv`.
  Environment creation, download and installation need authority; never change global Python.

## KI-0004: Context-sensitive patch application rejects a coordinated edit

- **Recognize:** `apply_patch` rejects expected context or malformed hunk lines.
- **Fix:** Read exact target spans and use the smallest stable semantic anchors.
  Preserve explicit line-level operation markers; inspect state after rejection.
- **Prevent or limit:** Do not retry the same patch; correct the mismatched hunk
  and prove uncertain patch shapes on a representative file within authorized scope.
- [Evidence](TROUBLESHOOTING_DETAILS.md#ki-0004-context-sensitive-patch-application-rejects-a-coordinated-edit)

## KI-0005: Default sandbox blocks an authorized Git metadata write

- **Recognize:** An authorized Git write meets the protected `.git` sandbox boundary.
- **Fix:** Once exact staging is requested or its commit authorized, request narrow
  platform escalation for that exact write on its first attempt; continue the original operation.
- **Prevent or limit:** Do not first provoke `.git/index.lock`; keep reads sandboxed.
  Never delete locks or change ACLs/trust to bypass this; action authority remains separate.
