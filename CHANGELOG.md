# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This project follows Semantic Versioning.

## [Unreleased]

- Compact repository-local fix memory to 4–8 lines per active case; preserve
  original evidence separately and load matching details only when needed.

- Adopt TVDR-0045: explicit commit authorization in commit-changes and
  commit-milestone includes the normal verified-upstream push unless excluded;
  other Git actions, tags, remotes and publication stay separately controlled.

- Adopt TVDR-0046: rename troubleshoot-environment to reuse-fixes. Consult only
  this repository's confirmed fixes, retain concise prevention and ask only for
  missing authority or blocking decisions, preserving all local domain gates.

- Add a bilingual README skill catalog with linked purposes and explicit or
  agent-driven invocation rules, preserving local workflow and access boundaries
  and attributing the optional planning skills separately.

- Complete the naming follow-up: align the idea-backlog title with AI Dev
  Template and the initialization skill's control-plane reference with Guarded
  Agent, preserving workflow and historical evidence.

- Adopt TVDR-0044: advisory task-fit reasoning, bounded authorized delegation,
  concise reporting and explicit same-objective context reuse. Preserve domain
  and access gates, fresh patch spans and the configured reasoning baseline.

- Adopt AI Dev Template and `ai-template-dev` in current identity, public
  links, engineering/setup guidance, mapping examples and skill references
  under TVDR-0042/0043. Preserve historical provenance, MIT licensing and
  engineering, release and Git authority.

- Implement IDEA-0020 under TVDR-0041. Normal sandboxed execution remains
  preferred when equally effective; already authorized in-scope actions request
  the narrowest sufficient platform escalation when technically required,
  without changing dependency, engineering, test, release or Git authority.

- Implement IDEA-0019 under TVDR-0040 with an ignored per-device retrospective
  repository mapping while preserving
  engineering provenance and roadmap authority. Initialization retains a known
  source-template path; retrospective routing verifies identity and baseline.

- Add demand-driven first-use readiness for Skill Creator validation through
  pinned PyYAML, an explicit-interpreter wrapper and portable KI-0002 while
  preserving existing package managers and dependency authority.

- Add portable KI-0001 for exact current-user Git ownership trust under the
  Windows sandbox, without granting filesystem or dependency access or changing
  engineering, test, release, Git or publication authority.

- Harmonize KI-0005 with the Templateverse first-attempt Git metadata contract.
  Already authorized staging and commits now request narrow sandbox escalation
  before their first write instead of probing the expected `.git/index.lock`
  denial, without changing dependency, test, release or Git authority.

- Harmonize KI-0004 with the Templateverse family contract. Bounded engineering
  work now prereads exact patch targets, uses stable semantic anchors, separates
  uncertain hunks and retains a portable recovery record without changing
  dependency, test, release or Git authority.

- Make completed task handoffs commit-stable: record durable task facts
  without claiming that the enclosing changes remain uncommitted or making
  versioning the next task, and reconcile continuation against live Git state.

- Make local runtime setup demand-driven, reproducible per clone and explicit
  about interpreter selection; preserve existing environment managers.

- Rebuild `troubleshoot-environment` around an undocumented quick exit or
  focused cause removal, direct explicit invocation, and acceptance at the
  original checkpoint or a pre-agreed standalone test. Remove the unspecific
  `optimize-codex` skill while preserving demand-driven setup.

## [v1.5.0] - 2026-09-02

### Added

- Add the pinned MIT-licensed `grill-me` and `grilling` skills to the
  template and new derived projects, with explicit-only invocation and an
  opt-in detailed path before the normal six-question initialization.

- Add the TVDR-0026 environment-troubleshooting skill and conditional portable
  plus ignored host-local known-issue records.
- Add a source-template `IDEAS.md` backlog for sanitized reusable
  retrospective candidates.
- Add the provider-neutral `COLLABORATION.md` contract with `AGENTS.md` as the
  sole resident repository file.
- Add repository-scoped collaboration skills and a tracked compact
  `TASK_HANDOFF.md` for the development-project lifecycle.
- Add provider-neutral synchronized external project storage for large non-Git
  input and materials that must remain available across devices.

### Changed

- Adopt TVDR-0030 so control-word requests include minimal copy-ready wording
  while keeping Git, engineering, release and publication actions separate.

- Adopt TVDR-0028's proportional lifecycle so ordinary work uses focused
  behavioral evidence and comprehensive engineering gates move to milestones.

- Reduce the source-template `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` to a focused initialization
  and current-state form below the shared context-residency target, routing
  general engineering workflow to its existing authorities.
- Make development-project initialization progressive: ask no more than six
  coherent fundamentals and defer architecture, tooling, test, deployment and
  release detail until concrete work needs it.
- Route recurring, setup, policy, permission and dependency-environment failures
  to signature-matched, authorized and verified engineering recovery.
- Interrupt recurring tool or environment failures for durable authorized
  diagnosis and verified recovery before resuming engineering work.
- Require successful project initialization to replace inherited template
  maintenance history in `CHANGELOG.md` and `TASK_HANDOFF.md` with project-owned
  state, and reinduce exact direct-prefix commit messages with meaningful bodies.
- Assign targeted engineering checks to implementation and the complete
  applicable repository gate to commit preparation, with earlier escalation
  only through an explicit risk or local completion requirement.
- Route retrospective findings explicitly to project, source-template or
  governance destinations with a Pending Idea Transfer fallback, and remove
  the template backlog during successful normal-project initialization.
- Remove active root `CODEX.md` and `ChatGPT.md`, route their current authority
  to the resident kernel, conditional collaboration and specialized documents,
  and make `commit-milestone` explicit-only.
- Replace the root initialization, continuation, harmonization, retrospective
  and local-project creation prompts with `$start-project` and scoped skills;
  retain `PROJECT_SETUP.md` as initialization method and provenance.
- Remove the project copy of `CREATE_LOCAL_PROJECT_PROMPT.md` and its
  template-only references after successful initialization.
- Clarify that generation alone does not make a file an output and distinguish
  retained engineering materials from project deliverables by workflow role.

## [v1.4.0] - 2026-07-26

### Added

- Replace the input inventory files with an external-file and source catalog,
  portable local path mapping and support for unchanged external sources.
- Add a shared, never-versioned `temp/` area with a restricted access boundary.
- Add a cataloged project-material workflow for retained engineering files in
  local, versioned or external storage.
- Add `CREATE_LOCAL_PROJECT_PROMPT.md` for independent local-only projects.
- Add a catalog-based workflow for external files and sources with
  `intake`, `restricted`, `local` and `versioned` input zones.
- Add `AGENTS.md` as the concise, automatically loaded entry point that routes
  AI agents to the complete engineering rules and validation guidance.

### Changed

- Upgrade the Collaboration Model to v1.20.
- Align the project-context template with input catalogs, temporary files,
  retained engineering materials and promotion into maintained code assets.
- Keep external input unchanged and distinguish project materials from source,
  tests, fixtures, configuration, caches and build outputs.
- Replace abstract artifact terminology in active guidance with clearer terms
  for files, records, inputs, outputs and deliverables.
- Align the initialization and continuation prompts with `AGENTS.md`: setup is
  an explicit one-time workflow, while continuation only reconstructs state.
- Expand continuous-improvement guidance with engineering evidence,
  candidate review and transparent, unlinked private Templateverse governance.

## [v1.3.0] - 2026-07-20

### Changed

- Clarify `INITIAL_PROMPT.md` as the sole maintainer entry point for agent-led
  initialization, separate language navigation from the collaboration note,
  move README authority guidance into documentation rules and link maintainer
  tools to their official sources.
- Standardize template README badges as status, version and license links and
  document how derived projects adapt badges without inheriting template state
  or advertising nonexistent automation.
- Upgrade the Collaboration Model to v1.19 and classify staging and unstaging
  as specifically requested index operations outside the control-word rule.

## [v1.2.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added

  lineage and harmonization baselines in `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, and clarify that
  documentation and repository guidance remain active project rules.
- Align the collaboration-model version in `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` with the
  current template baseline.

- Expand ADR checkpoint guidance for sensitive-input, fixture-versioning and generated-artifact decisions.
- Clarify that development projects may use PDRs and DDRs alongside ADRs when the decision subject calls for them.
- Clarify that project context should be refreshed after milestone commits or tags when pre-commit status remains documented.
- Clarify that template-only setup files may be removed or retained after initialization depending on project needs.
- Clarify that retained initialization files should keep their original names and may document setup status internally or in `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`.
- Clarify that regular working commits must use Conventional Commit prefixes while milestone commits should omit prefixes and include the completed version number.
