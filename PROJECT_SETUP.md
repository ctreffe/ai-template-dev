# PROJECT_SETUP.md

# Project Setup Guide

This document describes how to initialize a new project from the AI Dev Template.

It is primarily used during project creation and should normally remain in a
derived repository as initialization provenance. Record its lifecycle status
and the template lineage in `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`.

Use this template for development-oriented projects. For general non-development projects, start from the generic AI Project Template instead.

## Lean initialization contract

Before the normal questionnaire, `$start-project` asks one concise,
unnumbered routing choice: use the normal lean path or explicitly select
`$grill-me` for detailed initialization and planning. The routing choice is
not one of the six project questions. The skill is never invoked from a
suggestion; a suggestion is not consent. The maintainer may decline or stop
grilling and return to the lean path, and neither path changes any access,
versioning, transmission, publication or protected-action authority.

`$start-project` begins with no more than six fundamental maintainer
questions. Each numbered item is one coherent decision, not a container for a
hidden questionnaire:

1. What is the software project's identity and purpose?
2. Who will use or maintain it, and in which operating context?
3. What is the first useful capability, and what minimum evidence will show
   that it works?
4. What is currently in scope, and what are the explicit non-goals?
5. Which source, material, data or environment evidence may the assistant
   access now, and which sensitivity boundary applies?
6. Which technical or operational constraint must be fixed before work begins?

Use repository evidence for answers already established. The last question
includes only a constraint that is consequential now; do not turn architecture,
tooling, dependencies, storage, versioning, release and publication preferences
into a bundled survey. Keep safe template defaults for nonessential choices or
mark them explicitly undecided. Clarify detailed architecture, roadmap,
commands, test matrix, deployment and release policy only when a concrete task
needs them. Later dependency, security or protected-action questions remain
mandatory when triggered; the limit does not weaken those gates.

# 1. Create the Repository

Create a new repository from the AI Dev Template.

After creating the repository, establish the first working baseline:

- use the local repository working tree if it is accessible to the assistant and intended as the source of truth,
- use the public repository `main` branch if it is accessible and intended as the source of truth, or
- download the repository as a ZIP archive and use that ZIP as the working baseline.

When using AI assistance, make the baseline explicit before requesting repository-ready changes. Invoke `$start-project` for the one-time initialization.

---

# 2. Review Repository Metadata

Update the repository metadata on GitHub:

- repository name
- repository description
- topics
- visibility
- license

Use precise technical language.

Avoid promotional or marketing-oriented wording.

---

# 3. Review Project Documentation

Review and adapt the user-facing documentation:

- `README.md`
- `README.de.md`, if useful

The English README is the primary project documentation.

It should explain setup, configuration and productive use clearly enough that a new user can reach a successful first use without private maintainer context. If the project exposes commands, scripts, settings, profiles or operational workflows, add concise reference documentation or link to the appropriate reference document.

The German README may be kept, updated or removed depending on the target audience of the derived project.

If both are kept, maintain them as structurally aligned translations.

## Required AI Collaboration Note

Every project README should include an AI Collaboration Note directly below the badges.

The note is a standardized disclosure element. It should preserve the purpose, position and level of visibility of the template note, but the wording must remain factually correct for the derived project.

For the AI Dev Template itself, the note states that the repository maintains the AI Dev Template. For derived projects, adapt that project-specific sentence so it accurately describes the collaboration in the derived repository, while still pointing readers to `COLLABORATION.md`.

The derived note should also include one concrete sentence describing what the collaboration model documents in the project, such as engineering practices, collaboration workflows, validation expectations, handoff rules or repository conventions.

Before completing project setup, verify that:

- `README.md` contains an English AI Collaboration Note below the badges
- `README.de.md`, if kept, contains a German AI Collaboration Note below the badges
- the note describes what the collaboration model documents for the derived project
- both notes point to `COLLABORATION.md`
- no generated project update has replaced the note with a shortened variant

## README Badge Policy

Place the badge block directly below the README title and before the AI
Collaboration Note. Use this semantic order when the corresponding information
applies:

1. status
2. version
3. license
4. real build, test or documentation automation

Derived projects must replace the template badges with project-specific
information. Status must have a documented meaning, version must describe the
latest completed project state and license must match the repository. Add a
release or automation badge only when the corresponding tags, releases or
workflows actually exist. Do not use a last-commit badge by default because
recent activity is not evidence of quality or readiness.

Keep English and German badge blocks identical when both READMEs are present.
Record the AI Dev Template version and commit in `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, not as
the derived project's version badge.

---

# 4. Capture Maintainer Project Intent

Before establishing the initial roadmap, capture the maintainer's project intent and context.

This is the maintainer-owned description of why the project exists and what a successful end state should look like. It may describe a desired user experience, a technical capability, an operational workflow, a deployment model or another clear target.

Record this in the `Maintainer Project Intent` section of `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`.

At minimum, clarify:

- the problem space or operating context
- the intended users, maintainers or operating environment
- the desired end state
- important boundaries, risks and intentional non-goals
- immutable external-input handling and the cataloged project-material workflow
  for retained transformed or created files, including separate
  assistant-access, local/versioned/external storage and publication decisions
- fixture, dump, log, screenshot and generated-output handling, including when
  materials are promoted to a durable engineering role
- disposable `temp/` intermediates, which are always ignored and never
  versioned, plus the inaccessible `temp/restricted/` boundary
- who will inspect, review, debug, maintain or extend the code, what technical
  and domain knowledge those readers have, and whether English is the
  repository standard for code comments and documentation
- how these points shape the first roadmap milestones

Automated secret or sensitivity checks may support this review, but their
results are warnings rather than proof that a file is sanitized or safe.

The roadmap should be derived from this intent instead of from isolated technical ideas.

---

# 5. Create or Adapt PROJECT_CONTEXT.md

Create or adapt `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` for the derived project.

This document is the primary entry point for resuming work on the project. It should describe the current state rather than the full history.

At minimum, review and update:

- project name and repository
- maintainer project intent and desired end state
- current version or initial milestone
- current status
- current focus
- repository baseline
- completed milestones, if any
- roadmap
- validation status
- open decisions
- relevant documents
- Collaboration Model version
- AI Dev Template version

Keep this document concise. Its purpose is to help a maintainer, contributor or AI assistant quickly understand where the project stands today.

---

# 6. Establish the Initial Roadmap

Before implementation accelerates, establish an initial roadmap for the derived project based on the maintainer project intent.

The roadmap should identify the first meaningful milestones and explain what each milestone is meant to prove, decide or deliver. It should also name important non-goals and validation expectations.

The roadmap may evolve as the project learns, but starting with an explicit roadmap helps keep AI-assisted development focused and comparable across sessions.

Record the roadmap in `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` or a dedicated roadmap document if the project needs more detail.

---

# 7. Review Core Project Documents

The following documents usually remain in the derived project:

- `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`
- `README.md`
- `README.de.md` where useful
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `AGENTS.md` as the automatic agent entry point
- `COLLABORATION.md`
- `PHILOSOPHY.md`
- `LICENSE`

These documents define current state, user documentation, version history,
collaboration, resident agent safety, engineering philosophy and license.

---

# 8. Adapt Ongoing Project Rules

The following documents define ongoing project rules and should be adapted to
the concrete project rather than treated as disposable setup material:

- `DOCUMENTATION.md`
- `REPOSITORY.md`

Keep them current when documentation structure, repository practice or project
governance changes.

---

# 9. Update Project-Specific Content

Replace template-specific wording with project-specific content.

Typical updates include:

- project name
- repository description
- README overview
- setup instructions
- usage instructions
- badges
- version references
- links to related repositories

Keep documentation focused on the users and contributors of the derived project.

---

# 10. Review the Collaboration Model

Review `COLLABORATION.md`.

The file should usually be kept unchanged unless the derived project has a specific reason to adjust the Collaboration Model.

If the AI Dev Template contains a newer version of the Collaboration Model, prefer adopting the newer version.

---

# 11. Review the Resident Agent Contract

Review `AGENTS.md` for every derived project.

`AGENTS.md` retains the compact enforceable core, including:

- allowed local tools
- read-only Git usage
- approval-required actions
- forbidden actions
- local tool environments
- internet and data disclosure rules
- multi-repository safety
- delivery expectations

Keep `AGENTS.md` in the derived project as its provider-neutral resident entry
point. Adapt local boundaries without copying detailed workflows into it.

---

# 12. Prepare Local Tooling

Install or verify the local tools that are useful for the derived project.

Common tools include:

- Git for Windows
- GitHub Desktop
- PowerShell
- Python with project-local virtual environments
- Node.js where needed
- `rg` or another fast local search tool
- ZIP/archive tooling

Codex should prefer project-local tool environments over global tool changes.

Typical local tool directories and outputs include:

```text
.venv/
node_modules/
.codex-input/
.codex-cache/
.codex-tmp/
.codex-output/
generated/
deliverables/
```

These should normally remain ignored by Git unless the derived project intentionally uses a different structure.

---

# 13. Review the Project Philosophy

Review `PHILOSOPHY.md`.

The file should usually remain stable across projects.

Only change it if the derived project intentionally follows different engineering principles.

---

# 14. Initialize Versioning

Set the initial project version.

For most derived projects, the first meaningful project milestone should be:

```text
0.1.0
```

Future projects should use version tags with a leading `v`, for example:

```text
v0.1.0
v1.0.0
```

Do not increase the version merely because a milestone begins. Increase version metadata when the milestone is completed.

---

# 15. Prepare the First Project Commit

The first project-specific commit should describe the repository initialization.

Use a concise summary and a meaningful description. Regular working commits
use exact direct prefixes such as `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`,
`test:` or `chore:`; scoped forms such as `feat(scope):` are not used.
Milestone commits are the exception: they are human-readable, omit the prefix
and include the completed version number.

Example summary:

```text
chore: initialize project from AI template
```

Example description:

```text
Initialize the project from the AI Dev Template.

Review and adapt the README files, core project documents and repository
metadata for the new project. Capture maintainer project intent and establish
PROJECT_CONTEXT.md as the current state entry point for future development
sessions.
```

Initialization is complete when the six fundamentals are answered or already
evidenced, the first useful capability and minimum validation evidence are
recorded, current access boundaries and safe defaults are explicit and the
retained template state is internally consistent. Nonessential architecture,
tooling, roadmap and release fields may remain explicitly undecided. Do not
begin implementation that depends on an unresolved safety or authority choice.

The initialization commit is normally a regular `chore:` commit. Use an
unprefixed milestone commit only when initialization also completes a genuinely
defined and reviewed versioned milestone.

---

# 16. Record Initialization Provenance

Keep the initialization files under their original names:

- `PROJECT_SETUP.md`

Record initialization status and date, source template version and commit, later
harmonization baseline and intentional template deviations in
`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`. Remove an initialization file only as a deliberate,
documented maintainer exception.

After successful initialization, replace the inherited source-template
maintenance history in `CHANGELOG.md` with a project-owned changelog beginning
at `Unreleased`. Replace `TASK_HANDOFF.md` with a project-owned initialization
handoff containing only current project state, decisions, checks and the next
step. Preserve template lineage in `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, not in either active
project-history file. If initialization is incomplete, leave both resets
pending and identify the inherited content as non-authoritative.

`DOCUMENTATION.md` and `REPOSITORY.md` remain active project rules.

`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` should remain because it documents the current project state and supports future project resumption.

The repository skills and `TASK_HANDOFF.md` should remain after initialization.
Routine tasks use `start-task`; invoke `$review-project`, `$sync-template`,
`$check-consistency` and `$perform-retrospective` explicitly only when their
specialized outcome is required. Remove the project copy of
`$create-local-project` after successful initialization.

---

# 17. Start Development

After the initial setup commit, continue development according to the
Collaboration Model in `COLLABORATION.md`. Begin each bounded new task through
`start-task` and use `TASK_HANDOFF.md` for a versioned checkpoint.

When using Codex locally, also follow `AGENTS.md`.

Keep `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` current when completing milestones, changing the roadmap, resolving important decisions or preparing to resume the project in a new collaboration session.

When working with AI assistance:

- establish the current repository baseline
- capture or review the maintainer-owned project intent and desired end state
- establish or review the current roadmap
- agree on the next roadmap step
- implement small changes
- check whether important architecture, configuration-format, lifecycle, deployment, security, sensitive-input, fixture-versioning, generated-output, project-scope or documentation decisions need a decision record in `decisions/`
- keep user-facing setup, usage, reference and troubleshooting documentation aligned with behavior
- validate before commit whenever practical
- use small implement-validate-adjust-prepare loops during active milestones
- request repository-ready deliverables only after the plan is clear
- require actual files or repository changes, not simulated completion
- provide commit-ready guidance with a clear summary and description
- keep feature commits separate from milestone commits
- document assistant-written code well enough that maintainers and future contributors can understand it without chat history
- use English for assistant-authored code comments and doc comments when
  English is the repository standard
- tag meaningful completed milestones intentionally
- update `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` after a milestone commit or tag exists if the previous context described a pre-commit or pre-tag state
- expect numbered maintainer next steps when validation, review, commit or tag actions are needed

---

# 18. Retrospectives and Template Feedback

During project work, collect findings that may improve the AI Dev Template or the generic AI Project Template.

Template changes should not be made casually during normal project work. Instead, review collected findings in a retrospective.

The maintainer decides when to invoke a retrospective and which project period
it should cover.

Only changes that have proven useful in real project work should be considered for inclusion in the AI Dev Template.

When a retrospective changes core process guidance, update all affected template documents consistently instead of appending isolated notes.

# 19. Configure Synchronized External Storage When Needed

If large non-Git engineering files must be available on several devices, apply
`SYNCHRONIZED_STORAGE.md`. Decide provider transmission, stable project ID,
input and material scope, availability checks, conflict handling and backup.
Create ignored `sync:` mappings on every device. Do not use synchronized
storage as a substitute for maintained source, tests, fixtures, configuration,
runtime paths or build outputs, and do not synchronize `temp/`.

## Required local runtime setup

During initialization, check only what the first concrete outcome needs.
Reuse established answers; defer later tooling and do not add a mandatory
questionnaire. General optimization has no dedicated skill; concrete recurring
environment problems route through `reuse-fixes`.

Check the runtime needed for the selected outcome and the actual interpreter
used by its commands. A new clone/device does not inherit ignored environments;
missing local setup is not evidence of damage. Reuse the project's established
manager and isolation model. When Python is required and no suitable managed
environment exists, prepare a clone-local ignored .venv; do not create one for
a project without Python needs or copy one from another clone.

Track dependencies and lockfiles using existing project conventions (for
example requirements-tools.txt for Python helpers). Document reproducible setup
and explicit interpreter or manager commands. Prepare only needed local setup,
reuse existing approval and obtain any missing installation/download authority
before applying it. Verify the interpreter and a minimal relevant import or
original command; defer optional tools without blocking unrelated work.

Existing uv, Poetry or another project manager and its lockfiles take precedence;
do not introduce a competing environment or replace dependency management.
